## 🔧 Troubleshooting Work Laptops

### "Can't run .bat files"
- Right-click `run-on-work-laptop.bat` → "Open with" → "Command Prompt"
- Or use Method 2 (direct browser access)

### "Python not found"
- **No problem!** Use `run-anywhere.bat` - it has multiple fallbacks
- Try the PowerShell server: `serve.ps1`
- Or use direct browser access (Method 3)
- Works with ZERO dependencies installed

### "PowerShell execution disabled"
- Use `run-anywhere.bat` instead
- Or direct browser access (always works)
- Or try: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File serve.ps1`

### "Access blocked by IT"
- Use Method 2 (direct browser access)
- Save the `dist/` folder to a USB drive
- Run from there if local drives are restricted

### "Can't access localhost"

- Use Method 2 (direct file access)
